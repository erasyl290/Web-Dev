    <h1>My Doggy Ate My Essay</h1>
    <p>My doggy ate my essay.<br>
        He picked up all my mail.<br>
        He cleaned my dirty closet<br>
        and dusted with his tail.<br>
        <br>
        He straightened out my posters<br>
        and swept my wooden floor.<br>
        My parents almost fainted<br>
        when he fixed my bedroom door.<br>
        <br>
        I did not try to stop him.<br>
        He made my windows shine.<br>
        My room looked like a palace,<br>
        and my dresser smelled like pine.<br>
        <br>
        He fluffed up every pillow.<br>
        He folded all my clothes.<br>
        He even cleaned my fish tank<br>
        with a toothbrush and a hose.<br>
        <br>
        I thought it was amazing<br>
        to see him use a broom.<br>
        I’m glad he ate my essay<br>
        on “How to Clean My Room.”
