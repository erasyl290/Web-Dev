        Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, <em>certainly can’t do algebra</em>.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong><br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        <strong><em>Thankfully, we are born to learn.</em></strong><br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
        Until one day, <strong>you walk</strong>.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        <em>Each wrong answer</em> making your brain <strong>a little bit stronger.</strong><br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. <strong>learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, <em>yet</em>.
        Because <em>the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        <strong>are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.</strong></em><br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can learn anything</strong>.
